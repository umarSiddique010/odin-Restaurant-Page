## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is mobile-friendly and adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Users can easily navigate between pages (Home, Menu, About, Contact) using the navigation bar.
- **Interactive Menu**: Users can explore the restaurant's menu, view images, and see the prices for each dish.
- **Custom Styling**: The website uses custom CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing experience with a good typography, hover effects, animations, and a clear layout.
- **Hash Change Listener**: The `hashchange` event listens for any changes in the URL fragment and triggers the appropriate function to load the content (e.g., `loadHomePage()`, `loadMenuPage()`, etc.).




# Skills

## **Hash-based Routing**

- **This project implements client-side routing using the `window.location.hash` property. Instead of loading new pages from the server, the application listens for changes in the URL's hash to dynamically load different content on the same page. This approach is used for single-page applications (SPAs).**


## **Webpack**: Module bundler for JavaScript files and assets

- **Bundling JavaScript files**
- **Transpiling**
- **Using Babel to convert modern JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Backward-compatible JavaScript for older browsers**
